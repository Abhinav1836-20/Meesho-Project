# Meesho-Project
This project is a Meesho-inspired e-commerce homepage banner developed using HTML and CSS. The objective of the project is to replicate the top layout, navigation menu, promotional banner, and key service highlights of a real online shopping platform.The header section represents the top bar of the website and includes the Meesho logo, a product search bar, and multiple navigation links such as supplier registration, investor relations, profile, and cart.The search bar is centrally placed within the header to allow users to easily search for products like sarees, kurtis, or product codes. It uses a flexible layout so that it automatically adjusts to available screen space, improving usability and user experience on both large and small screens.




Below the header, a horizontal navigation menu displays various shopping categories such as women’s wear, men’s wear, kids, home & kitchen, and accessories.The banner section is the visual highlight of the page and features a large background image with promotional text. It communicates the brand message “Smart Shopping, Trusted by Millions” and includes a Shop Now button to encourage user interaction.




Below the banner, an information section highlights key services such as 7-day easy return, cash on delivery, and lowest prices. These points build customer trust and are displayed in a rounded container to visually separate them from the rest of the page content.The entire website uses a single CSS file to maintain consistent fonts, colors, spacing, and layouts.The project is limited to static front-end development and does not include backend functionality such as product listings, user login, or payment processing. However, it serves as a strong base for integrating JavaScript and backend technologies in future enhancements
